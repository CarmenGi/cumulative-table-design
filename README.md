# Cumulative Table Design Example

This repo shows how to build a robust cumulative table design with an example of monthly active users. 

In this repo, we'll be using **2022-01-01** as 'today' and **2021-12-31** as 'yesterday'


The steps for this design are:

- The Daily Table step
  - In this step we aggregate just the events of today to see who is daily active
  - This query is pretty simple and straight forward check
